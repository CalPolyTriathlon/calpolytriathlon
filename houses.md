## Cal Poly Triathlon Houses Competition

#### What in the heck is this?

Think Harry Potter houses. We split up members onto 3 different teams that become their team within the broader CP Tri team. These teams compete with one another to see who can log the most points based on things like relays at practice, Aquadong and TTs (ie. timed events), and other silly and fun events outside of triathlon specific activities. At the end of the year, weâ€™ll have a winner! 

#### How does it work?

Each team has a captain/co-captain that is responsible for recording member participation at the various events. Make sure to remind your leadership to record those points.

#### Is this similar to the buddy competition?

Yes! Every event you participate in will be rewarded with points, similar to the buddy program in years past. Instead, this year, those points will go to a broader team point total in a club-wide competition against one another.
