Welcome to Cal Poly Triathlon! We’re excited you are interested in joining our team. Below you will find the basic steps to identify if our team is for you, and how you can join once you’ve decided it is. We welcome any and all interested people to come to our practices or team meetings, and tryouts are not required to race, train, or even just hang out with us. If you have any further questions, feel free to email vicepresident@calpolytriathlon.com

## Step 1: Joining our email list

The first step in joining our team is filling out the New Member interest survey. This will allow us to contact you regarding team meetings, events, and practice updates.

## Step 2: Show up!

We would love to see you at one of our team events! It is not important if you cannot make any of the weekly practices, but attending one of these or a team meeting lets us put a face to a name, and makes the entire club experience more engaging and rewarding. [All our practices and meetings can be found on our calendar](/calendar).

After you start attending practice we give you two weeks to decide if our team is for you before requiring dues or a formal team registration.

## Step 3: Official Registration

Official team registration takes only a few minutes on __Cal Poly Now__. Once you've decided to join, you can register for the team here:

    <a class="btn btn-dark" href="https://now.calpoly.edu/engage/forms?query=Participation">Participation Agreement</a>
</div>

_Make sure you fill out both the Participation Agreement and join the roster!_

Once both these forms are completed, you are an official rostered CP Tri member that can attend all of our events, including travel, practices, and races.

### Team Dues

The final step will be paying __dues__, but we will contact you as you become rostered as to the amount and timeline on which dues are required.
