The Cal Poly Triathlon Team is a club sport on campus that encompasses swimming, running and biking, appealing to any experience level.

Whether beginner or expert, you are welcome here! We are one of the biggest and best teams in the nation and compete at an elite level annually in the West Coast Collegiate Triathlon Conference.

We hold practices for each sport and host fun events and excursions. Joining the team is a great way to meet friends and explore the area. With access to stunning open roads, beaches and running trails, San Luis Obispo is a wonderful place to train and enjoy nature.

While none of our [practices](/calendar/) are mandatory, they are strongly encouraged. Attending workouts is not only a great way to hone your skills with our coaches, but also a great way to meet other triathletes on the team!

We have meetings every __Thursday starting at 11:00am in 026-0104__. Stop by to see what weâ€™re about, or feel free to contact any of the officers or coaches with any questions you might have!
