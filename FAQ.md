Cal Poly’s Triathlon Club gets lots of questions from new and prospective members. In order to provide some guidance and direction for those interested in the club, we put this FAQ together. 

#### Is the team for experienced triathletes, or can newbies join too?

We welcome participants of all skill levels.  There are some experienced and competitive triathletes in the club, but there are also lots of newer triathletes who want to learn about the sport.  

While it helps to have a “base” in one of the disciplines – swimming, biking, or running – it is not mandatory.  You will find that triathlon is an incredibly welcoming sport, both as part of the club as well as on race day.

If you are on the fence, you should join!

#### What kind of gear do I need to participate?  Is it expensive?

Being involved in triathlon doesn’t require a ton of gear, but there are a few things you will want to have ready – many of which you very likely already own.

To start, you need to have the basic gear for all 3 legs of the sport:
Swimming: Jammers or a swimsuit and goggles for practice.  Perhaps a wetsuit for races, but not mandatory.
Cycling:  A bike, bike helmet, shoes, and basic bike clothing like bike shorts.  Many triathletes practice indoors in a spin room, which makes the bike optional for many practices.
Running:  Running shoes, and general workout gear which you likely already own.

Additionally, on race day, most triathletes wear tri-specific clothing like a singlet or tri shorts.

Regarding the bike, you can spend a lot of money on a bike but you don’t have to.  Any road bike will be competitive in triathlon, and a tri-specific bike is marginally better.  But you can always borrow or buy used if you don’t have the budget for a new bike.

Many items are available for rent on race day, too.  Wetsuits are commonly available for rent, and you can sometimes even rent a bike for a week.

#### Do you help with training plans?

Many of the more experienced racers can provide guidance on training plans, and our natural cadence of practices generally provides a good base-building phase for your tri season.

You can also find training plans online, both paid and free.  Obviously, the plan differs based on which distance race you are doing.

To help with your training, it is good to be able to track your workouts and manage your pace, duration, and intensity.  If you don’t have a fitness tracker you like, you may want to consider a triathlon watch to help make your training more precise.

#### What if I am nervous about swimming?

Well, then you are not alone!  The swim leg is probably the one thing that keeps people from trying triathlon.  Conquer it, and you will feel a great sense of accomplishment!

Swimming is so good for your body, you will likely get hooked on a weekly swim once you start doing it.  If you are not a swimmer, start out slow in the pool.  Triathletes usually focus on the freestyle (or front crawl) stroke, so you don’t need to master all different types of strokes.

There are lots of coached swim classes available, and our practices will help you become a more confident swimmer too.  Don’t let the swim leg become a barrier.
