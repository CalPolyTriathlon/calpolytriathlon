## Step 2: Show up!

We would love to see you at one of our team events! no worries if you can't make some or any of the weekly practices, but attending one of these or a team meeting is the best way to get involved. [All our practices and meetings can be found on our calendar](/calendar). Athletes of any skill level are welcome to join any of our practices, so __SEND IT__ and show up to something!

After you start attending practice you'll have 2 weeks to decide if our team is for you before you formally register for the team.

## Step 3: Official Registration

Official team registration takes only a few minutes on __Cal Poly Now__. Once you've decided to join, you can register for the team here:

_Make sure you fill out both the Participation Agreement and join the roster!_

Once both these forms are completed, you are an official rostered CP Tri member that can attend all of our events, including travel, practices, and races.

### Team Dues

The final step will be paying __dues__, but we will contact you as you become rostered as to the amount and timeline on which dues are required.
