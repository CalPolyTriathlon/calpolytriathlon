## Step 1: Joining our email list

The first step in joining our team is filling out the New Member interest survey. This will allow us to contact you regarding team meetings, events, and practice updates.

## Step 2: Show up!

We would love to see you at one of our team events! It is up to you which practices youâ€™d like to show up to, but attending one of these or a team meeting is the best way to get involved. [All our practices and meetings can be found on our calendar](/calendar). Athletes of any skill level are welcome to join any of our practices, so __SEND IT__ and show up to something!

After you start attending practice you'll have 2 weeks to decide if our team is for you before you formally register for the team.

## Step 3: Official Registration

Official team registration takes only a few minutes on __Cal Poly Now__. Once you've decided to join, you can register for the team here:

    <a class="btn btn-dark" href="https://now.calpoly.edu/engage/forms?query=Participation">Participation Agreement</a>
</div>

_Make sure you fill out both the Participation Agreement and join the roster!_

#### Team Dues

The final step will be paying team dues. Dues pay for things like food at events, pool times, team shirts, and our pro-coach. Annual dues are $100.

Dues can be payed by either by either check or cash to either the president, treasurer, or vice president.

Once both these forms are completed and you've payed dues, you are an official rostered CP Tri member and are welcome to attend all of our events, including travel, practices, and races. In addition, you'll be added to the team email list and slack channel.
